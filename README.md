# SSIM - robustness of the image quality metric

Structural similarity index measure, SSIM, is a commonly reported metric to assess image quality, however, it can be sensitive to image scaling among other parameters unrelated to visual quality. This investigation explores the robustness of the metric. It was submitted as an abstract to the ISMRM Workshop on Sampling and Image Reconstruction in Sedona 2023.
